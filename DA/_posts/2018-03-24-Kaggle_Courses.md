The area for Data Analytics(DA) is a big field. From the choice of languages to the frameworks/APIs available, one may wonder what are some of 
the available resources out there to demystify this field?
<br />
<br />
I have identified three main resources to learn DA.
1. [Kaggle Hands-On Data Science Education](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview)
Some of the available tracks at the time of writing are i) Machine Learning, ii) Pandas, iii) Data Visualisation, iv) SQL, v) R and vi) Deep Learning,
Language of choice is Python and exercises are written in notebook style. Familarity of basic Python is required which can be picked up at
[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) for free.
2. Codecademy
3. Datacamp
