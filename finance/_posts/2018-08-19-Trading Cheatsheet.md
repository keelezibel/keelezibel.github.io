## Support and resistance
### Support and resistance
Support and resistance is not a single line, but an area on the chart

### Role reversal
Role reversal happens when support or resistance is broken.

### Dynamic support and resistance
Occurs in uptrend or downtrend. Use EMA (20 and 50) for identifying support and resistance.

### Impulse and corrective moves
Impulse points towards direction of the trend. Candlestick size usually larger, signaling momentum.
Corrective points against trend. Candlestick size usually smaller

## Four stages of market
