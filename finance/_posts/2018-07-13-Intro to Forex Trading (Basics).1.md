I came across this interview with Rayner on trading matters and found his insights pretty 
interesting. Happens that he has his own website called [TradingwithRayner]("https://www.tradingwithrayner.com") too. Most importantly, he has a series of educational videos
on trading for FREE! Having procrastinated on formally creating a trading plan, I decided to embark
on this endeavor to cover his videos.
