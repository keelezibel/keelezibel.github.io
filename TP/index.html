<h3>Google Analytics</h3>
<p>
    Google Analytics is a web analytics tool I use to help understand how visitors engage with this website. It reports website trends using 
    cookies and web beacons without identifying individual visitors. You can read <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html">Google Analytics Privacy Policy</a>.
    <br />
    <br />
    Google Adsense, a third party affiliate marketing network, uses cookies to help make sure I get a commission when you buy a product after 
    clicking on a link or ad banner that takes you to the site of one of their merchants. You can read <a href="http://support.google.com/adsense/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=48182">Google Adsense Privacy Policy</a>.
</p>

<h2>Disclosure Policy</h2>
<p>
    I make money on this website through affiliate programs. If you click an affiliate link or ad banner and buy the product, you help 
    support this website because I’ll get a percentage of that sale.
    <br />
    <br />
    Currently I’m an affiliate for Google Adsense.
